# Context

Every entity inside DTZ needs to have a parent context. This represents the organizational structure to hold an entity, allow access control, and provides accounting and billing.

The current context is always shown in the title bar on the top left.

Changing the context can be achieved by selecting the new context from the drop-down menu.

A new context can be created through the main page.
